    This report details the design, implementation and testing of Mitchell's
    Candidate Elimination Algorithm (CEA).  CEA is a learning algorithm based
    off inductive learning that can be used to learn a set of data then classify
    unseen instances from this dataset.  The language used for this
    implementation was `Ruby`__, this allowed a very simple to understand object
    oriented approach with a minimum of code (the main algorithm and supporting
    code requires just 167 lines, including whitespace).  The algorithm was a
    success with the provided dataset, it easily learnt and classified the
    required tasks.
