Conclusion
||||||||||

The project was a success.  The CEA algorithm was able to correctly train and
classify the test cases.

One possible improvement could be to revert the algorithm to the original one in
the handout.  This would provide a slight performance boost, but would harm the
readability of the code.

All source code used for this report (including the restructuredText to build this report) is available in `my github repository`__.
